Below are the guidelines for

## Getting Started

- Read this [step by step guide](https://link.medium.com/7AjLJHdO02) to get your code into this repository

- Pick a sorting algorithm you would like to add, make sure no one has written it.

- Create a new file in the `src` directory `<SORTING_ALGORITHM_NAME>/index.js`. Eg. `quick/index.js` make sure the sorting algorithm hasn't been written already

- create a new file to write your tests `<SORTING_ALGORITHM_NAME>.spec.js` e.g `quick.test.js`

- I wrote `bubble/index.js` and `bubble.spec.js` feel free to use it as a template
